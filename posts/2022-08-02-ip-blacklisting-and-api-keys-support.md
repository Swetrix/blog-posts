Hi everyone reading this post!
<br />
We are working hard on Swetrix, adding new improvements every day, so I'm happy to announce that today we released a few new features!
<br />
<br />

**1. IP blacklisting**
<br />
This feature was requested by one of our customers and now it's here!
<br />
It allows you to write a list of IP addresses from which no analytics will be collected on the specified project. Also you can specify IP address masks and IPv6 addresses.
<br />
This functionality is handy if you want to ignore analytics from your IP.

<br />

**2. API Keys**
<br />
From now on, you can generate an API Key to access our service.
<br />
As for now, our API is still not available for public access with API keys (but we're working on it), but these API keys are useful for our other services.
<br />
For example, you will be able to set up integrations with platforms like Telegram or Slack to make your use of Swetrix even more comfortable.

That is all for today.
