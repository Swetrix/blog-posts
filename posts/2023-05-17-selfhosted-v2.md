üéâ We're happy to announce that we've finally released Swetrix Selfhosted version 2. It's been more than a year since the last release and a lot has changed during that time.

  <li>Added traffic comparison feature.</li>
  <li>Drastically improved stability: fixed an issue when users were not able to delete the projects or update some settings under various circumstances.</li>
  <li>Added support for timezones & time notations for the self-hosted version.</li>
  <li>Redesigned the Dashboard and the app overall and added multiple new languages.</li>
  <li>Added user flow functionality, added an ability to change the style of charts.</li>
  <li>Added an ability to see what visitors are currently live on your website.</li>

<b>‚ùóÔ∏è Beware that this release has breaking changes that may affect you!</b>

Before migrating to the v2 release, we **strongly** advise you to back up all of your data. Previous self-hosted versions of Swetrix are not compatible with v2 and there may be database-related issues when upgrading.
We have tried to make the upgrading process as smooth as possible, but you may suffer a data loss! Please, always do backups.

To migrate from v1 to v2 you have to run the `selfhosted_v1_to_v2.js` script which is located in the `migrations/clickhouse` directory.
Do not run this script twice as it may cause data corruption in your Clickhouse instance.

To test if the migration engine works at all, we advise you to run `test_migration.js` script first. There should not be any errors printed out.

‚ÑπÔ∏è We also updated some environment variables, please take a look at our <a href="https://docs.swetrix.com/selfhosting/configuring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selfhosting documentation</a> to see the current configuration requirements.

Thank you for using Swetrix and we hope you enjoy it! Much more cool updates will be released soon!
