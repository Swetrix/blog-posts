## Bag those 20% Commissions

Here's the deal: For every customer you refer to Swetrix using your unique affiliate link, we'll send 20% of their subscription fees directly to your PayPal account, as long as they remain paying customers. That's real money in your pocket with every successful referral.

## Not paying for the service yet? No problem!

The best part? You don't have to be a paying Swetrix customer to become an affiliate. Signing up for our affiliate program is free, and you can start earning commissions right away. It's a win-win for you.

## How It Works

It's as easy as 2+2! Head over to the "Referral program" tab in your Account Settings, where you'll find your unique affiliate link. Use this link to refer potential customers to Swetrix. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, we'll kindly ask them if they'd like to set a cookie in their browser, which lasts for 30 days.

If they decide to register with Swetrix during this period, they become your trial referral. And here's the exciting part: If they later upgrade to a paid plan at any point, you'll earn a generous 20% commission on our profits from that customer.

It is worth mentioning that we calculate commissions for paid referrals at the start of their next billing cycle. If a customer cancels their subscription before the next billing cycle begins, you won't receive a commission for that customer.

Let’s take a look at the example to explain it more clearly:
if a customer signs up for a $50/month plan, you'll receive a $10 commission when they pay for their second month. However, if they cancel before the second month, you won't receive a commission.

## Extra Perks for Your Referrals

Every person you refer to Swetrix will also enjoy a 20% discount on their first month with us. It's a fantastic offer and beneficial for you both, making your affiliate link even more appealing.
