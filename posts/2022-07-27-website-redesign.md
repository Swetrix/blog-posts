The new design of our website has been published today, and with it the new strategy for our business.
Very soon we will be introducing new functionality: a marketplace and custom extensions to the dashboard.
<br /><br />
You will be able to supplement the functionality as you wish or you can write your own widgets and earn money from them and build up popularity.

<br />

In addition, this year we plan to introduce the biggest update, which will revolutionise web analytics with a focus on privacy.
<br />
The point of Swetrix is to become a 'de-facto' tool every website owner will use.
<br /><br />
It's still in development, but your feedback would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks for using our service and have a nice day :)
