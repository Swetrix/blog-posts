## Open Source & Self-hosting

A major distinction is in our approach to software freedom. Swetrix is **fully open-source** and supports **self-hosting**, giving you the power to audit our code or run the analytics on your own servers. This ensures complete data sovereignty and transparency - you don't have to take our word for it, you can verify it yourself.

In contrast, Fathom Analytics is a proprietary, closed-source solution. You cannot inspect their code or host it independently, meaning you are fully dependent on their cloud infrastructure and cannot verify the software's inner workings.

## Performance Monitoring

Swetrix isn't limited to just counting visitors; we also keep an eye on your site's health. Our built-in **performance monitoring** tracks vital speed metrics such as page load times, DNS resolution, and Time to First Byte (TTFB). This helps you ensure your site remains fast and responsive.

Fathom Analytics, only focuses on basic traffic stats and does not track these technical performance indicators.

## Depth of Analysis (Funnels, Maps, Errors)

While Fathom Analytics excels at simplicity, it falls short if you need granular insights into user behaviour.

Swetrix provides a comprehensive suite of analysis tools that go deeper:

- **Conversion Funnels:** Create custom funnels to pinpoint exactly where users drop off during critical flows like checkout or sign-up.
- **User Flow Visualization:** See a visual representation of the paths users take through your website.
- **Error Tracking:** Automatically detect and log JavaScript errors so you can fix technical issues before they impact your users.
- **Interactive Maps:** Visualize your traffic sources on an interactive world map, offering a more intuitive view than simple country lists.
- **Custom Alerts:** Set up notifications for specific events, traffic spikes, or errors, delivered directly to your preferred channels.

## Growth & Product Features

Swetrix includes powerful tools for product growth that Fathom lacks:

- **Experiments (A/B Testing):** Optimize your site with privacy-friendly A/B tests.
- **Feature Flags:** Manage feature releases and rollouts.
- **Revenue Analytics:** Integrated revenue tracking with Stripe and Paddle.
- **AI Chat:** Ask questions about your data and get instant answers.
- **User Profiles:** Track MAU/DAU and user retention.

## Teams & Role Management

Swetrix is built to scale with your organisation. We offer full support for **Teams and Organisations**, allowing you to invite colleagues, manage permissions, and collaborate seamlessly. You can define specific roles (like Admin or Viewer) to ensure everyone has the appropriate level of access. At the same time, you can also use Swetrix as a standalone analytics tool for your personal website or blog.

Fathom Analytics is primarily designed for individual users or small setups. While it offers basic dashboard sharing, it lacks comprehensive organization management and granular role-based access control, making it less suitable for growing teams or agencies.

## Conclusion

If you want the absolute simplest tool, don't need funnels or deep behavioral insights, and don't mind a closed-source product, **Fathom Analytics** is a great choice.

If you prefer an **open-source** solution that offers **deeper insights** - like performance monitoring, funnels, user flows, and error tracking - and gives you the option to self-host, **Swetrix** is the better option. It combines the simplicity of privacy-friendly analytics with the power of advanced tools.
