Swetrix and [Matomo](https://matomo.org) (formerly Piwik) are both open-source alternatives to Google Analytics that value data ownership. However, we represent two completely different eras of web analytics.

Matomo is the "legacy" giant - a powerful but heavy tool built on older technology (PHP/MySQL) that tries to clone the Google Analytics experience. Swetrix is the "modern" challenger - built on a next-generation stack (ClickHouse) to be lightweight, fast, and privacy-first by design.

Here is a quick comparison to help you decide which one fits your needs.

## Why choose Swetrix over Matomo?

## The "Free" Self-Hosting Trap

One of the biggest misconceptions about Matomo is that the self-hosted version is completely free. While the _core_ software is free, Matomo charges significantly for "Premium Features" that are standard in modern analytics tools.

Want **Funnels**? That's €179/year.
Want **User Flows**? That's €79/year.
Want **Search Engine Keywords**? That's €79/year.
Want **Web Vitals**? That's €79/year.
Want **Error Tracking**? That's €154/year.

If you want a fully featured analytics suite, your "free" self-hosted Matomo can easily cost you **over €500/year** in plugin subscriptions only.

With **Swetrix**, we don't nickle-and-dime you. Features like Funnels, User Flows, and Performance Monitoring are included in our core product - whether you use our Cloud or self-host it.

## Modern Growth Tools included

In addition to the basics, Swetrix includes modern product growth tools that Matomo either lacks or charges extra for:

- **Experiments (A/B Testing):** (Paid plugin in Matomo)
- **Feature Flags:** (Not available in Matomo)
- **Revenue Analytics:** Track MRR/Revenue from Stripe or Paddle.
- **AI Chat Assistant:** Query your data with natural language.

With Matomo, you are often working with a legacy stack. Swetrix gives you a modern, full-stack growth platform.

## Performance: Lightweight vs. Bloated

Matomo was built in the era of PHP and MySQL. While reliable, it can be heavy on your server resources, especially as your traffic grows. Its tracking script is also significantly larger (>22KB gzipped vs Swetrix's ~3KB), which can impact your website's load time.

**Swetrix** is built on modern **TypeScript** tech stack and **ClickHouse**, a high-performance column-oriented database designed specifically for analytics. This means:

1.  **Blazing fast queries**, even with millions of data points.
2.  **Lower server footprint** for self-hosters.
3.  A **tiny footprint** on your website's frontend.

## Privacy: Cookie-less by Design

Matomo _can_ be configured to be cookieless, but out of the box, it often relies on cookies and requires complex configuration to be fully compliant with GDPR/PECR without a consent banner.

**Swetrix** is **cookie-less by default**. We use [privacy-preserving fingerprinting](https://swetrix.com/data-policy#sessions-tracking) (hashing IP + User Agent + Salt) that rotates daily, ensuring you get accurate unique visitor counts without ever storing personal data or tracking users across the web. You don't need a complex cookie banner to use Swetrix.

## User Interface: 2025 vs. 2010

Matomo's interface is famous for being... "comprehensive." It mimics the old Google Analytics (UA) interface, with hundreds of menus, sub-menus, and settings. For most users, it's overwhelming and requires a steep learning curve.

Swetrix is designed for **clarity**. We give you the insights you need - traffic trends, conversion funnels, performance metrics - in a clean, modern dashboard that anyone can understand in seconds. You don't need to be a data scientist or have extensive training to understand your data. We believe analytics should answer questions, not create more of them.

## Conclusion

**Matomo** is a solid choice if you are a large enterprise that needs a legacy-style analytics suite, has a dedicated DevOps team to manage a heavy PHP/MySQL stack, and has the budget for expensive premium plugins.

**Swetrix** is the choice for modern developers, startups, and agencies. If you want a lightweight, high-performance, and privacy-friendly tool that includes advanced features (like Funnels and Performance Monitoring) without hidden costs or bloat, **Swetrix** is the superior alternative.
