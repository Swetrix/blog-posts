Hello, reader. This is the first article of the monthly Swetrix digest where we tell you what changed this month, what are we planning to do and other related news.
But firstly...

<h2 id="need_your_help">
  We need your help to translate the project.
</h2>

Swetrix is an open-source project and we rely a lot on the community and people who help us.
We're a small team with limited resources and can't afford freelancers to translate the project into different languages, so in the translation part, we fully rely on our community.

<br />

In this list are the languages we currently support and need your translation help.
If you're willing to contribute, you can do so by going to our <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/swetrix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crowdin page</a> and submitting your translations.
If you're willing to contribute but don't see your language in that list, please <a href="https://swetrix.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact us</a>.

Thanks a lot, and now let's talk about the changelog..

<h2 id="whats_new">
  What's new in April
</h2>

<h3 id="user_flow">
  User flow functionality
</h3>

<i>User flow diagram</i>
<br />

One of the biggest features we added this month is user flow. By using this functionality you can track user interactions and navigation patterns throughout your application, providing valuable insights for optimising user experience and engagement.
<br />
To access the user flow diagram please go to the project Dashboard, find the Page panel and click on the diagram icon there!
<br />
To track user flow, you have to upgrade Swetrix NPM library to version v2.2.1 or higher. If you're using Swetrix via the swetrix.org tracking script - no actions are required from your side.

<h3 id="sso">
  Google & Github SSO
</h3>

Now you can register or log in to your Swetrix account via Github or Google. You can also link your SSO provider of choice in Account settings to ease the login process. And as always, all of this is cookieless and open-source.

<h3 id="redesign">
  Dashboard redesign
</h3>

<i>This is how the new Dashboard looks like</i>
<br />

We fully redesigned our Dashboard page, no more junk data or 2015 design vibes, now it all looks clear and brings you bird's eye insights on your connected websites.
<br />
We also improved the dark theme colours throughout the application and optimised the project Dashboard page for larger screens.

<h3 id="small">
  Smaller but nonetheless important updates.
