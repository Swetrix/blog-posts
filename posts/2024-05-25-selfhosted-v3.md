Over 1 year have passed since our [previous selfhosted release](https://swetrix.com/blog/selfhosted-v2). At that time, it was a solid product with unique and very useful features. But now, we're happy to introduce: Swetrix Selfhosted v3.

It's a very powerful release, with dozens of unique features and hundreds of hours spent into it. We've made it more stable and even easier to install and use.
