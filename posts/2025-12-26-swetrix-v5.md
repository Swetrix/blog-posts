Today marks a significant milestone in our journey. I am incredibly proud to introduce **Swetrix v5** – the most impactful and feature-rich update we have ever released.

For the last couple of months, we've been working hard with one goal in mind: to build the absolute best open-source Google Analytics alternative on the market. We wanted to create a tool that doesn't just "count visits" but gives you deep, actionable insights while strictly respecting user privacy.

With v5, we haven't just added features; we've redefined what you can expect from privacy-focused analytics.

## 👥 User Profiles

One of the biggest challenges in privacy-friendly analytics is understanding user journeys across multiple sessions without invasive tracking. Swetrix v5 solves this with our new **Profiles** feature.

You can now analyse long-term user behaviour and link distinct sessions to anonymous user profiles. This allows for much more accurate retention analysis and user journey mapping.

**How does it stay private?**
We built this with a privacy-first architecture. We **do not** use cookies, and we **do not** store raw IP addresses for profile tracking. Instead, we use a combination of non-identifiable signals (like user agent) and a salt to generate a completely irreversible identifier (a similar mechanism to how we track sessions, but with a different, longer living salt).

For those who need even more precision (and have user consent), we've added the ability to pass your own custom User IDs, giving you the most accurate analysis possible for logged-in users.

## 🤖 Swetrix AI: Chat with your analytics

Data is only as good as the insights you can extract from it. With our new **Ask AI** feature, you don't need to be a data scientist to understand your metrics.

You can now have a conversation with your data. Ask our AI agent questions like:

- _"Why did my traffic spike last Tuesday?"_
- _"Compare the conversion rate between mobile and desktop users."_
- _"Show me a chart of revenue growth over the last month."_

The AI agent can access your data, generate custom reports, visualise trends with charts, and find correlations you might have missed. Best of all, this feature is **available for all users**.

## 💰 Revenue Analytics: Connect Traffic to Value

Traffic is great, but revenue is what sustains a business. Swetrix v5 introduces comprehensive **Revenue Analytics**.

You can now connect your **Stripe** or **Paddle** (other payment providers are coming soon) accounts directly to Swetrix. Our SDK allows you to attribute payments to specific sessions and users.

- **Visualise your growth:** See revenue and refund analytics in clear, easy-to-understand charts.
- **Deep attribution:** Understand exactly _which_ sessions lead to purchases. See where your paying users came from and what actions they took on your website before converting.

Revenue analytics integrates with our other features like Profiles or Sessions, allowing for even more insights.

## 🧪 A/B Testing & Feature Flags

We are moving beyond just "analytics" into a full product growth platform. Swetrix v5 introduces **Feature Flags** and **Experiments (A/B Testing)**.

- **Feature Flags:** Safely roll out new features to a percentage of your users and manage them in real-time.
- **A/B Testing:** Test different versions of your site to see what performs best, backed by Swetrix's robust data tracking.

Combined with our new **Goals** tracking, you have everything you need to optimise your product for conversion.

## 🛡️ Reborn CAPTCHA

Something we built years ago was CAPTCHA. It was quite a simple solution - your users needed to solve a basic puzzle to prove they are human - but it was poorly executed.

Puzzles, even more complex ones, can now be easily solved by AI, and they're very annoying to legitimate users, and an even worse nightmare for accessibility.

So we're rolling out a new CAPTCHA solution that is much more user-friendly and privacy-friendly, and does not require your users to solve a puzzle.

Instead, it's based on a proof-of-work algorithm that requires your users computers to do some math to prove they are legitimate users.

Although it's still not 100% perfect in protecting your website from bots, it's a huge improvement over the old CAPTCHA. It's already included in all of our paid plans and is billed as 1 captcha completion = 1 event.

## 🎨 A Complete UI Redesign & More

We've given Swetrix a fresh coat of paint and made it more intuitive, modern, and beautiful. From the dashboard to the settings, everything feels snappier and easier to use.

You'll notice a lot of things like new charts on the dashboard, new panels design, less inconsistencies in the UI and much more.

We'd love to hear your feedback too! Join our [Discord](https://swetrix.com/discord) and let us know what you think.

## Community Edition

Most of these new features are coming to the next Swetrix CE release.

It's estimated to go live on January 2026.

## The Future of Swetrix

Swetrix v5 is more than an update; it's a statement. We are proving that open-source software can compete with - and exceed - the capabilities of proprietary giants, without compromising on privacy or user experience.

We invite you to try out the new features and let us know what you think. If you're new to Swetrix, there has never been a better time to jump in.

We offer a 14-day free trial (no credit card required), so [give it a try](https://swetrix.com) :)

Happy tracking! 🚀
