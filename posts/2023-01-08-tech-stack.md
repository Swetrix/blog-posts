Have you ever thought about the technologies and frameworks that go into building and running a web analytics SaaS? The tech stack of a company is an important factor in its product development and growth. It's like a recipe, with each component contributing to the overall success of the platform.

I've always been curious about what technologies or languages other companies use to build their products. It's always interesting to see the running costs of companies, whether you need this information for your own side project or just out of curiosity.

And now it's time to reveal our tech stack - the tools and technologies that power our open-source and privacy-focused web analytics SaaS, <a href="https://swetrix.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Swetrix</a>.

<h2 id="languages">
  Languages
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TypeScript</a>: all the backend is written using this language. We chose it due to how powerful yet simple this language is and a huge support of the community.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript</a>: used on the frontend side in combination with React. We chose not to migrate to TypeScript yet due to how readable and non-bloated React code using simple JS is, the types validation is done via Prop-types library instead.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="frameworks">
  Frameworks
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://remix.run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remix</a>: in my opinion it's the best frontend framework there is. It allows your React app to be rendered server-side (you may even set it up in a way where not a single byte of JS is loaded to client!). They have great docs, often release updates and overall is a very pleasant framework to work with.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tailwind CSS</a>: using this framework saved us a ton of time designing and making our frontend. IMO it was one of the best technical decisions to migrate from SCSS to Tailwind.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://naver.github.io/billboard.js/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billboard.js</a>: we use it as a charting library on our dashboards. Quite a decent and customisable charting library, based on D3.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://nestjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nest.js</a>: all our APIs are written using this framework. It's a very scalable, fast, efficient and widely supported framework. The more you use it the more you appreciate it, being able to share the entities and interfaces between the endpoints, the methodologies it uses makes you love it more and more every day. Also it's based on TypeScript which is great for making reliable APIs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python Django</a>: our blog (you're reading it right now!) is written using this framework.
  </li>
</ol>
