<h2 id="what_is">What is a UTM parameter?</h2>
UTM stands for “Urchin Tracking Module,” which initially commenced in Google Analytics (they acquired a product known as Urchin many years ago).

They are now recognized in much more places than simply Google Analytics and are used as an industry standard.
And fortunately, if you employ them on websites without Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager, no data is sent to Google.

The information in the URL known as a UTM parameter helps you determine which of the pieces of content you're distributing is the most pertinent or effective at generating leads or sales.

Creating and tracking UTM links doesn't require some technical skills, violating people's privacy, or writing complex code and even our UTM builder may be used to construct these links.

Take a look at the following link:
<br />
`https://swetrix.com/docs?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=ads&utm_medium=paid_ads&utm_term=analytics&utm_content=text_ad`
<br />
At a glance it may look difficult to understand, but actually it's not. Let's break down each piece of it in a more understandable format:
<br />
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>utm_source</b> - the website or platform that is generating the traffic.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>utm_campaign</b> - the campaign that is generating the traffic.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>utm_medium</b> - traffic-generating marketing channel type.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>utm_content</b> - the specific content user clicked on.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>utm_term</b> -  the specified paid keywords.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when">When should I use UTM parameters?</h2>
You want to see where your users are coming from when you are running an advertising campaign on Google or social media.

You employ additional strategies to draw readers and potential clients, and you are curious about their origins.

Using e-marketing services, you send newsletters to your subscribers, and you want to monitor how effective they are.

<h2 id="how">How to create UTM parameters?</h2>
You can use the following template to paste your UTM parameters into the link `https://example.com/?utm_source=[SOURCE]&utm_medium=[MEDIUM]&utm_campaign=[CAMPAIGN]&utm_term=[TERM]&utm_content=[CONTENT]` or use the
<a href="https://url.swetrix.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UTM builder application</a>
we specifically created for that reason.

<h2 id="tips">Some tips for using UTM codes and UTM tracking</h2>
UTMs can be any terms you choose, but when making them, it's crucial to keep the following in mind:
<br />
<ol>
  <li>
    UTM links should only be utilised for links that lead to other websites.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use no punctuation, emojis, or other special characters.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep your capitalisation in lowercase (certain platforms may make UTMs case sensitive, which could result in several results for the same thing; for example, "GOOGLEADS" and "googleads" would track as two different UTM parameter values).
  </li>
  <li>
    Instead of using spaces in URLs, use underscores or plus signs to prevent URL errors that can cause a 404 error to load in place of your website.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep things simple and memorable, otherwise in future you may not remember what some specific UTM metric means.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be careful not to use the incorrect UTM parameter or to use the UTM parameter which you don't plan to. Verify that the UTM parameters are set to the appropriate values for the link you are utilising every time. 
  </li>
</ol>
