Swetrix and [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com) are web analytics products that both focus on privacy and simplicity. We both share a common goal: tracking website traffic without compromising user privacy. Both are not using cookies to track users. However, we cater to slightly different needs.

Simple Analytics is known for its strict focus on simplicity, offering a simple dashboard with essential metrics. Swetrix offers a similar level of privacy and ease of use but includes more advanced features for deeper analysis, such as performance monitoring, session analysis, error tracking, and is fully open-source.

Here is a quick comparison to help you decide which one fits your needs.

## Why choose Swetrix over Simple Analytics?

## Open Source & Self-hosting

One of the biggest differences is that Swetrix is **fully open-source** and **self-hostable**. You can inspect our code, contribute to it, or host it entirely on your own infrastructure for free. This ensures you have full ownership and control over your data, and ensures our pledge to verifiable transparency.

Simple Analytics is a proprietary, closed-source product. You rely entirely on their cloud infrastructure and cannot verify the code quality or host it yourself.

## Performance Monitoring

Swetrix goes beyond just traffic stats by tracking **web performance metrics**. These metrics show how fast your website loads for your users, and include metrics like Time to First Byte (TTFB), DNS resolution time, and page load speeds.

Simple Analytics focuses strictly on traffic statistics (visitors, pageviews) and does not provide performance monitoring features.

## Depth of Analysis (User Flows, Errors)

Simple Analytics lives up to its name by keeping things simple. However, if you need to understand user behavior in depth, Swetrix offers more robust tools:

- **User Flow:** Swetrix provides diagrams that visualise exactly how visitors navigate through your site.
- **Error Tracking:** Swetrix can track JavaScript errors occurring on your website, helping you fix bugs that might be affecting conversion rates.
- **Geolocation Map:** Swetrix includes a map visualisation to see where your users are coming from, whereas Simple Analytics only provides country-based list.
- **Funnels:** With Swetrix, you can build your own funnels to track your user journeys, and see how many users make it from one step to the next. Simple Analytics does not provide this functionality.
- **Alerts:** Swetrix includes alerts to notify you when certain events occur, such as a new user signing up, a pageview being recorded, or a JavaScript error being logged. These alerts can be sent to you or your team by Slack, Discord, Telegram or custom webhooks. Simple Analytics does not provide this functionality.

## Growth & Product Tools

Swetrix offers a suite of tools to help you actively grow your business, not just measure it:

- **Experiments:** Run privacy-friendly A/B tests.
- **Feature Flags:** Safely manage feature rollouts.
- **Revenue Analytics:** Track financial metrics alongside traffic.
- **User Profiles:** Understand user retention with MAU/DAU tracking.

While Simple Analytics focuses purely on the "stats", Swetrix gives you the tools to improve those stats.

## Conclusion

If you want the absolute simplest tool and don't mind a closed-source product, **Simple Analytics** is a great choice.

If you prefer an **open-source** solution that offers **deeper insights** - like performance monitoring, user flows, and error tracking - and gives you the option to self-host, **Swetrix** is the better option. It combines the simplicity of privacy-friendly analytics with the power of advanced tools.
