Swetrix and [Umami](https://umami.is) are both open-source, privacy-focused web analytics solutions. We share a philosophy of transparency and ownership: both platforms allow you to self-host the software, own your data, and track users without cookies.

Umami is a fantastic tool if you want a lightweight, simple dashboard that covers the basics. However, Swetrix is built for those who love the open-source ethos but need the power and depth of an enterprise-grade analytics platform.

Here is a quick comparison to help you understand the differences.

## Why choose Swetrix over Umami?

## Key Difference: Performance Monitoring

Umami is strictly for tracking traffic. It tells you how many people visited your site, but it tells you nothing about their experience.

Swetrix includes full **Performance Monitoring**. We track Core Web Vitals and other technical metrics like Time to First Byte (TTFB), DNS resolution time, and page load speeds. You can see if your site is slow for users in specific countries or on specific devices. With Swetrix, you don't just measure traffic; you measure the _quality_ of that traffic.

## Key Difference: Proactive Alerts & Errors

With Umami, you have to log in to the dashboard to know what's happening. If your traffic spikes or your site breaks, you won't know until you check.

Swetrix is proactive.

1.  **Error Tracking:** We automatically catch JavaScript errors on your site. You'll know immediately if a deployment broke your checkout button.
2.  **Alerts:** Set up custom alerts for traffic spikes, specific events, or error rates. Swetrix can notify you via Email, Slack, Telegram, Discord, or Webhooks.

Umami has neither of these features, leaving you reactive rather than proactive.

## Key Difference: Depth of Analysis

Umami's philosophy is "simple analytics," which often means "limited analytics."

- **User Flows:** Swetrix visualises the actual paths users take through your site with Sankey diagrams. Umami has no flow visualisation.
- **Maps:** Swetrix offers an interactive geolocation map to visualise your audience. Umami only provides a text list of countries/cities.
- **Multiple Domains:** Swetrix allows you to track multiple domains (e.g., `example.com` and `docs.example.com`) under a single project view. Umami treats them as separate sites, fragmenting your data.

## Conclusion

**Umami** is a great choice if you want a minimalist, "set it and forget it" counter for your personal blog, and you want it to be open-source.

However, if you are building a business or a serious project, or just need **actionable data** - like knowing why users leave, where errors are happening, and how fast your site loads - **Swetrix** is the superior open-source choice. We give you the depth of enterprise tools with the freedom of open source.
