## Growth & Experiments

Rybbit is great for seeing what happened. Swetrix helps you _change_ what happens.
We provide built-in **A/B Testing** and **Feature Flags**. Want to know if that new button color converts better? Or safely roll out a new feature to 10% of users? Swetrix handles that natively. Rybbit just watches from the sidelines.

## Alerts: Don't Wait to Check the Dashboard

With Rybbit, you have to log in to see if your traffic spiked or your site crashed.
Swetrix sends **real-time alerts** to your email, Slack, Discord, or Telegram. Traffic surge? JavaScript error spike? You'll know instantly. We monitor your site 24/7 so you don't have to.

## AI Chat: Stop Clicking, Start Asking

In Rybbit, if you want to know "How many visitors from France on mobile last week?", you have to fiddle with filters and date ranges.
In Swetrix, you just type: _"How many visitors from France on mobile last week?"_ into our AI chat, and it gives you the answer. It's 2025, you shouldn't have to be a database admin to get answers.

## Security: 2FA is Non-Negotiable

Your analytics data is sensitive business intelligence. Rybbit relies on a simple password.
Swetrix supports **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** to keep your account secure. In an era of constant data breaches, relying on just a password is a risk you shouldn't take.

## Conclusion

Rybbit is a newcomer with a respectable feature set for a young project. It's open-source and covers the analytics basics well.
But if you need a mature, secure **Growth Platform** that actively helps you grow (A/B testing, Feature Flags) and keeps you secure (2FA)—**Swetrix** is the professional choice. We've been building this since 2021, and it shows.
