intro: "Swetrix vs PostHog. Simplicity meets power. Swetrix offers a privacy-first, lightweight alternative that's easy to self-host and understand, without PostHog's complexity or unpredictable costs."
---

Swetrix and [PostHog](https://posthog.com) are both powerful, open-source analytics platforms, but they serve different philosophies and user bases.

**PostHog** describes itself as an "OS for product analytics." It is an incredibly feature-rich, all-in-one platform that includes session replay, feature flags, A/B testing, and a data warehouse. It is designed primarily for product teams and engineers who want to build custom queries, SQL dashboards, and deeply analyse every user interaction.

**Swetrix** is a lightweight, privacy-first web analytics solution. It focuses on simplicity, ease of use, and providing actionable insights without requiring you to be a data engineer. Swetrix is designed for marketers, developers, and business owners who want to understand their traffic and user behaviour immediately, without configuring complex dashboards or managing heavy infrastructure.

Here is a quick comparison to help you decide which one fits your needs.

## Simplicity vs. Complexity

This is the fundamental difference between the two platforms.

**PostHog** is built for power users. It offers immense flexibility - you can write SQL queries, build complex custom dashboards, and integrate with data warehouses. However, this power comes with a steep learning curve. Setting up meaningful reports often requires time, configuration, and maintenance. It is a tool built _by_ developers _for_ developers.

**Swetrix** is built for clarity. We believe that analytics should be accessible to everyone. Our dashboards are pre-configured to show you the most important metrics (visitors, sources, performance, errors) instantly. You don't need to build a dashboard to see your bounce rate or top referral sources; it's just there. If you want the data without the "work" of setting up a data product, Swetrix is the better choice.

## Ease of Self-Hosting

While both platforms are open source, their self-hosting stories are vastly different.

**Swetrix** is designed to be lightweight and easy to deploy. You can get a fully functional Swetrix instance running on a modest VPS in **about 5 minutes** using Docker. It requires minimal resources and maintenance, making it realistic for individuals and small teams to self-host.

**PostHog**, on the other hand, is a complex distributed system. A production-ready PostHog instance requires managing ClickHouse, Kafka, Zookeeper, Redis, and Postgres. PostHog themselves have [sunsetting support for Kubernetes](https://posthog.com/blog/sunsetting-helm-support-posthog) for hobbyists because it is so difficult to maintain. Self-hosting PostHog is a serious infrastructure commitment, not a 5-minute task.

## Privacy First vs. Product First

**PostHog** is a product analytics tool first. Its default mode uses cookies to track users across sessions and devices to build comprehensive user profiles. While it has cookie-less modes, its core value proposition relies on deep, invasive tracking to fuel features like session replay and feature flags.

**Swetrix** is privacy-first by design. We use cookie-less tracking methods that respect user privacy and GDPR/PECR compliance out of the box. We do not store personal data by default and anonymise IP addresses. We aim to give you the insights you need while respecting your users' privacy. Check out our [data policy](https://swetrix.com/data-policy) if you want to learn more.

## Predictable vs. Usage-Based Pricing

**PostHog** uses a usage-based pricing model. While they offer a generous free tier, costs can become unpredictable as your product grows. A sudden spike in traffic or a spam bot attack can lead to a surprisingly high bill if you aren't careful with event limits.

**Swetrix** offers **predictable, flat-rate pricing**. You know exactly what you will pay each month, regardless of whether you have a busy week or a quiet one. We don't punish you for your success.

## Independent vs. VC-Backed

**PostHog** is a large, VC-backed company (Y Combinator alum). This drives them to constantly expand into new verticals (Data Warehouse, CDP, etc.) to justify valuations, often increasing complexity.

**Swetrix** is an **independent, bootstrapped project**. We answer only to our users, not investors. Our roadmap is driven by what makes the best analytics experience, not what drives the most enterprise revenue. We are committed to remaining lean, open, and focused on our core mission.

## Conclusion

If you are a **large engineering team** building a complex product and need a customisable data platform with SQL access, **PostHog** is the industry standard for a reason.

If you want a **privacy-friendly, easy-to-use** analytics tool that you can **self-host in minutes** or use via our cloud without worrying about complex setups or unpredictable bills, **Swetrix** is the better choice. We give you the insights you need - performance, traffic, errors, and flows - simplified.
